          <p>
            <strong>Overall Impression:</strong> An elegant, malty German amber
            lager with a clean, rich, toasty and bready malt flavor, restrained
            bitterness, and a dry finish that encourages another drink. The
            overall malt impression is soft, elegant, and complex, with a rich
            aftertaste that is never cloying or heavy.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>History:</strong> As the name suggests, brewed as a stronger
            “March beer” in March and lagered in cold caves over the summer.
            Modern versions trace back to the lager developed by Spaten in 1841,
            contemporaneous to the development of Vienna lager. However, the
            Märzen name is much older than 1841; the early ones were dark brown,
            and in Austria the name implied a strength band (14 °P) rather than
            a style. The German amber lager version (in the Viennese style of
            the time) was first served at Oktoberfest in 1872, a tradition that
            lasted until 1990 when the golden Festbier was adopted as the
            standard festival beer.

          <h2>6B. Rauchbier</h2>
          <p>
            <strong>Overall Impression:</strong> An elegant, malty German amber
            lager with a balanced, complementary beechwood smoke character.
            Toasty-rich malt in aroma and flavor, restrained bitterness, low to
            high smoke flavor, clean fermentation profile, and an attenuated
            finish are characteristic.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>History:</strong> A historical specialty of the city of
            Bamberg, in the Franconian region of Bavaria in Germany.
            Beechwood-smoked malt is used to make a Märzen-style amber lager.
            The smoke character of the malt varies by maltster; some breweries
            produce their own smoked malt (rauchmalz).

          <h2>6C. Dunkles Bock</h2>
          <p>
            <strong>Overall Impression:</strong> A dark, strong, malty German
            lager beer that emphasizes the malty-rich and somewhat toasty
            qualities of continental malts without being sweet in the finish.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>History:</strong> Originated in the Northern German city of
            Einbeck, which was a brewing center and popular exporter in the days
            of the Hanseatic League (14th to 17th century). Recreated in Munich
            starting in the 17th century. The name “bock” is based on a
            corruption of the name “Einbeck” in the Bavarian dialect, and was
            thus only used after the beer came to Munich. “Bock” also means
            “Ram” in German, and is often used in logos and advertisements.
