# CITS5505_group-project

This repository is dedicated to the CITS5505 group project, focused on building a request forum application.

## Get Started

1. Create a virtual environment (venv) for the project in VSCode:

   - Use the shortcut `Cmd + Shift + P` to access VSCode commands.
   - Select `> Python: Select Interpreter`.
   - Click on `Create Virtual Environment - Venv`.
   - Use the shortcut `Cmd + J` to open the terminal.
   - If the terminal command line starts with `(.venv)`, you're in the virtual environment.

2. Use `requirements.txt` to install the necessary libaries.

```shell
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. Start the Flask App. The app runs on http://127.0.0.1:5000.

```shell
flask run (optional: --debug)
```

## Testing

1. Install flask-unittest from the requirements.txt.

```shell
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
